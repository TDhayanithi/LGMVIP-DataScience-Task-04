# LGMVIP-DataScience-Task-04
Project 4 involved developing an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to read handwriting using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. ANN is a deep learning model inspired by the structure and functioning of the human brain. CNN is a specialized type of ANN widely used for image-related tasks due to its ability to learn spatial hierarchies of patterns.
